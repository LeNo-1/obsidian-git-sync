# Force 
> [!Note] A **force** is anything that causes the velocity of an object to change (Anything that *causes acceleration*)

$Force \propto \frac{change\space in\space momentum}{time} \mid Force\propto \frac{mv-mu}{t} \mid F\propto m\frac{v-u}{t}$
$$F = ma$$
### Newtons
**1 Newton** is the *force* that gives a *1kg* an acceleration of *1ms^2* (1kg ms^2)

## Newtons Laws of Motion
### Newtons First Law
An object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will continue moving at a constant velocity in a straight line unless acted upon by an external, unbalanced force
### Newtons Second Law
The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass (Used in deriving F=ma)

## Momentum
### Principle of Conservation of Momentum
States that any interaction *between two or more bodies* the *total momentum* of the bodies *before the interaction* is equal to the *total momentum after* the interaction **provided** no external forces act on the system of bodies
$$m_1u_1+m_2u_2=m_1v_1+m_2v_2$$
or if the bodies **coalesce**
$$m_1u_1+m_2u_2=(m_1+m_2)v$$
