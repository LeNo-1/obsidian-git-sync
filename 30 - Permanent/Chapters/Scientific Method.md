## - The Process

^97c148

1. Observation
2. Hypothesis {[[#^ca7760]]}
3. Experiment {[[#^f59639]]} 
4. Data {[[#^ca5020]]}
5. Conclusion
6. Replicate {[[#^3e9ad5]]}
7. Theory {[[#^79bb0e]]}

## - Planning and Designing
###### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">A good experiment has:</mark>
- Carefully planned and designed
- Carried out safely
- Include a control [[#^67bd4d]]
- Be free from bias
##### Controlled experiments
- When carrying out an experiment, all conditions should be kept the same except the one being tested.
- The **independent variable** are the conditions kept constant.
- The **dependent variable** is the variable being measured.
##### Avoiding bias
- Large sample size
- Random selection
- Replicates
- Double-blind test *(placebo)*
