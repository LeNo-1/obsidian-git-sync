#### Work
**Work** is the amount of energy needed to apply a force of ==1 Newton== for a distance of ==1 Meter== (1Nm)

The SI Unit of work is Joules(J)

###### :LiArrowBigDownDash: Formula for Kinetic Energy

$$E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$

###### :LiArrowBigDownDash: Formula for Gravitational Potential Energy
$$E_P=mgh$$
###### :LiBarChart:Kinetic energy is inversely proportional to Gravitational energy
#### $\frac{1}{2}mv^2+mgh=E$
