# Momentum and Impulse
## Momentum
$$Momentum = Mass\times Velocity$$
- Measured in $kg\space m\space s^{-1}$ (*Newtons second Ns*)

### Principle of Conservation of Momentum
>[!NOTE] In any interaction between two or more bodies, the **total momentum** of the system of the bodies **before the interaction** *is equal to* the **total momentum** of the system of bodies **after the interaction**, provided *no external force* acts on the bodies

$$m_1u_1 +m_2u_2=m_1v_1+m_2v_2$$
- If the bodies **coalesce** after collision:
$$m_1u_1 +m_2u_2=(m_1+m_2)v$$
## Impulse
$$F=\frac{mv-mu}{t}\rightarrow Ft=mv-mu\rightarrow Impulse = mv-mu$$
- Impulse is *Change in Momentum*

# Collisions with Solid Surfaces and Bouncing Projectiles
## Law of Restitution
For one body:
$$-e=\frac{v}{u}$$
For two bodies:
$$-e=\frac{v_2-v_1}{u_2-u_1}$$

# Direct Collisions involving inequalities

$$0\le e\le 1$$
# Oblique Collisions
##### $$a\cdot b=|a||b|\cos \theta \newline$$
##### $$\cos \theta =\frac{a \cdot b}{|a||b|}$$
### How To Answer
 1. **Identify the Line of Centres**

- At the moment of collision, draw the line joining the centres of the two objects. This is called the **line of centres** (or line of impact)

- 2. **Resolve Velocities into Components**
		
	- Split each object's velocity into two components:
	    
    - **Parallel to the line of centres** (affected by the collision)
        
    - **Perpendicular to the line of centres** (unaffected by the collision)


- 3. **Apply Conservation Laws and Restitution**
		
	- **Momentum Conservation (along the line of centres):**
		$m_1v_1cos⁡β_1+m_2v_2cos⁡β_2=m_1u_1cos⁡α_1+m_2u_2cos⁡α_2$
	    
	    Where u = initial speed, v = final speed, $\alpha$ = initial angle, β = final angle.
	    
	- **Perpendicular Component (no change if smooth):**
	    
		v1sin⁡β1=u1sin⁡α1v1sinβ1=u1sinα1v2sin⁡β2=u2sin⁡α2v2sinβ2=u2sinα2
		Each object's perpendicular velocity stays the same after collision
	    
	- **Coefficient of Restitution (e):**
	    
	    $v_2cos⁡β_2−v_1cos⁡β_1=e(u_1cos⁡α_1−u_2cos⁡α_2)$
	    This relates how "bouncy" the collision is (e = 1 for perfectly elastic, e < 1 for inelastic)

- 4. **Solve for Unknowns**
	- Use the above equations to solve for the final speeds and directions of both objects after the collision
