## Intro
> Light is a **form of energy** that travels away from the source producing it at a speed of about $3 \cdot 10^8  m/s$ 
- Travels in straight lines
- Measured with a device called *Crooke's radiometer*
#### Types of Beams

- Parallel Beam: A beam of light that remains the same width
- Diverging Beam: A beam of light that spreads out
- Converging Beam: A beam of light that narrows

> The bouncing of light off an object is called **reflection**

***Diffusion Reflection***: If the surface on which the light shines is rough, the **reflected light is scattered in all directions** from the surface. 
***Regular Reflection***: If the surface of an object on which light shines is silvered and polished smooth the light falling on it is not scattered in all directions. Instead the **reflected rays are parallel to each other**.
 - The ray of light falling on the mirror is called the incident ray
 - The line drawn perpendicular to the mirror where the ray strikes the mirror is called the normal at the point of incidence
 - The ray


A mass M kg is at rest on a smooth horizontal table. It is attached to a light, inextensible string. The string passes over a small, fixed pulley at the edge of the table and then passes under a small moveable pulley P, of mass m kg. Finally, the string passes over a smooth fixed pulley and supports a mass of 1 kg
