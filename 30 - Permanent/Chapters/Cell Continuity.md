*DEFN* - Cell continuity means the ==existing cells divide== to produce ==new cells==.

*Chromosome DEFN* - A chromosome is a ==thread like structure== found in the nucleus of a cell made of DNA and protein.
 **Note:** Chromosomes are only visible when a cell is dividing

*Haploid DEFN* - A cell is haploid (n) if it contains ==one copy== of each chromosome.
e.g. egg cells and sperm cells have 23 single chromosomes, n = 23

*Diploid DEFN* - A cell is diploid (2n) if it contains ==two copies== of each chromosomes. e.g. skin cells have 23 pairs, 2n = 46

*Cell cycle DEFN* - Cell cycle describes ==cells activities== in a state of non-division (==interphase==) and division (==mitosis==)

*Mitosis DEFN* - Mitosis is the type of cell division which parent cell divides to give ==two identical== daughter cells with the ==same number of chromosomes== as the ==parent cell==.
-> Mitosis is a replication or copying process

## Interphase
![[Cell Continuity-20241020192209691.webp|237]]
 This is the phase of the cell cycle when the cell is not 
**Key Events:**
1. Copies are made of the genetic material - chromosomes
2. Copies are made of the cell organelles
3. Respiration occurs to build up the energy necessary for cell division

## Prophase
![[Cell Continuity-20241020192557628.webp|240]]

1. Prophase begins when the chromatin threads condense - shorten and thicken to become visible as ==chromosomes==. Each chromosome has ==already replicated== itself and the two replicas are joined at a point called the ==centromere==
2. The nucleolus disappears and the ==nuclear membrane breaks down==
3. Protein fibres start to set up a spindle, which runs from one centriole of the cell to the other
## Metaphase
![[Cell Continuity-20241020203814055.webp|240]]
- The duplicated chromosomes line up along the equator of the cell. The spindle fibres attach to the chromosomes at their centromeres.

## Anaphase
![[Cell Continuity-20241020203852111.webp|240]]
1. The centromeres split.
2. The spindle contracts pulling the duplicated chromosomes apart towards opposite end of the cell.

## Telophase
![[Cell Continuity-20241020204110829.webp|240]]
1. A nuclear membrane forms around each group of chromosomes.
2. A nucleolus appears in each nucleus.
3. The chromosomes become long and thin i.e. revert to chromactin.
###### Cytokinesis 
![[Cell Continuity-20241020225044819.webp|240]]
- *Animal cell* - Takes place by means of a constriction or groove called a ==cleavage furrow==, which develops down the centre of the cell dividing in two
- *Plant cell* - a ==cell plate== grows across the middle laying down in a new cell wall on either side.

## Role of mitosis
*Unicellular Organisms* - Reproduction
e.g. binary fission in bacteria or amoeba
*Multicellular Organisms* - Growth and Replacement of dead cells
e.g. in humans

# Meiosis
*DEFN* - MEIOSIS is the type of cell division in which a diploid parent cell divides to give four haploid daughter cells.
->Meiosis is a reduction division

## Importance or Role of meiosis
1. There is no increase in the number of chromosomes in the animal offspring.
2. Introduces genetic variation.

### Examples of Meiosis:
1. Formation of sperm in the testes and eggs in the ovaries.
2. Germination of zygospore in Rhizopus

## Mitosis vs Meiosis

| Offspring have same number of chromosomes as parent | Offspring have half the number of chromosomes as parent |
|            Offspring identical to parent            |   Offspring are not identical to each other or parent   |

# Cancer
*DEFN* - Cancer is loss of control of the rate of mitosis leading to uncontrolled multiplication of abnormal cells.
**CAUSES:** Carcinogens[^1] e.g. cigarette smoke - lung cancer, UV radiation - skin cancer

*Tumours DEFN* - mass of cells or growth
*Benign DEFN* - Not life threatening e.g. warts, skin tags.
*Malignant DEFN* - invade other cells and move around the body
