# Cell Membrane
- The cell membrane controls movement of substances in and out of the cell
-> ***Selectively permeable*** - This means it allows the passage of some molecules while preventing the passage of others.
- <u>Active transport</u> is the movement of material that involves no use of energy. 2 forms: Diffusion , Osmosis.
# Diffusion
Diffusion n is the movement of molecules from high concentration to a lower concentration.
***Plant Ex.*** -Gaseous exchange in leaf
***Animal Ex.*** -Gaseous exchange in alveoli
# Osmosis
Osmosis is the movement of water from a high concentration of water to a lower concentration of water through a semi-permeable membrane.
- Special case of diffusion but ==only involves water== and a ==selectively permeable membrane==.
***Plant Ex.*** -Uptake of water through roots
***Animal Ex.*** -Red blood cells intake of water in
