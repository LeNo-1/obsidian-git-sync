## Cell Metabolism

>[!note] **Metabolism** — is the sum of all the chemical reactions that occur in a cell

###### Anabolic (Synthetic)
>[!note] **Anoblic reaction** — involve building up of molecules to form more complex molecules 

$A+B\rightarrow AB+energy$
**Ex.** Photosynthesis, 
###### Catabolic 
>[!note] **Catabolic Reactions** — involve the breakdown of complex chemicals into simpler chemicals

$AB+energy\leftarrow A+B$
**Ex.** Respiration
## Enzymes 
>[!note] **Enzymes** — are protein catalysts found in living organisms 

**Catalysts** — have the ability to speed up chemical reactions without being used up in the process 
___
#### Structure
Like proteins they are made by the ribosomes in the cell. Their shape is described as folded and consists of a long chain of amino acids folded to take a specific 3D shape

**Active Site** — the region the enzyme to which the substrate attaches
#### Action

$substrate+enzyme\rightarrow product$

**Substrate** — the chemical/s with which the enzyme reacts
**Product** — the substance formed

## Factors Affecting Enzyme Action

### pH
**Optimum pH** — the pH at which the enzyme works best *(6-8)*

If the pH goes above or below the optimum pH, the enzyme becomes less effective- *Denatured* **(reversible)**
### Temperature
**Optimum Temperature** — the temperature the enzyme works best
Human : $37\degree C$ | Plant : $25\degree C$

At high temperatures ($65\degree C$) there is no activity, because of the enzyme is *denatured* **(irreversible)**

## Role of Enzymes in Industry

 **Bioprocessing** — the use of enzyme-controlled reactions to produce a product

>[!note] **Immobilised Enzyme** — an enzyme which is attached to an inert material. (*Ex. Sodium Alginate*)

**Advantages**:
- Easy *recovery* of enzymes
- Enzymes can be *reused*
- The product is *pure*
- The enzyme can *last longer*

**Ex.** Lactose-Free milk - immobilised lactase
