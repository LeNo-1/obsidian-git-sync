## Kingdom of Fungi
- Multicellular (With an exception of yeast)
- Have a nucleus
- Made up of ==thread-like structures composed of many cells== called hyphae
- A single organism containing many hyphae is called a mycelium
- ==Heterotrophic==
- Reproduce by ==spores==
### Nutrition in fungi
**Saprophyte** - an organism that lives off dead things
**Parasite** - an organism that lives in or on another organism
### Importance of Fungi
Beneficial fungi:
- Yeast used in making bread and alcohols
- Mushrooms
Harmful fungi:
- Fungi can attack crops
- Can spoil food e.g. Rhizopus
## Rhizopus
- Cause bread mould 
- multi-nucleate
- nuclei are haploid (n)
#### Three types of hyphae in Rhizopus
1. **Stolons** - Hyphae that grow across the surface of the substrate
2. **Rhizoids** - hyphae that grow down into substrate. provide anchorage and absorb digested food
3. **Sporangiophores** - hyphae that grow vertically upwards
#### Mode of Nutrition
Rhizopus are saprophytic heterotroph
Gets its nutrition by releasing enzymes
Digested food is absorbed back into the hyphae and can be used for respiration
-> ==External digestion==
#### Reproduction and lifecycle
Rhizopus can reproduce both ==asexually and sexually==. The normal reproduction is asexual. **Sexual reproduction happens only under harsh conditions** i.e. lack of water or food
### Asexual reproduction
1. Hyphae grows vertically and forms a sporangium.
2. Mitosis occurs in sporangium. (Haploid Spores)
3. In dry conditions the sporangium dries out and burst releasing spores into the air.
4. If spores land on substrate a new mycelium will form.
### Sexual Reproduction
It involves the formation of a tough, resistant **zygospores**. 
___
1. + and - strains grow **close together**.
2. **Swellings form** along the length of the hyphae and touch.
3. **Nuclei move into** each swelling.(now known as progametangia)
4. **Cross-walls** form to produce **gametangia**, which are held in place by suspensors.
5. The **wall** between the gametangia **breaks down**
6. Fertilisation occurs when two nuclei fuse. Many **diploid nuclei form**.
7. A tough, resistant outer wall forms around the old gametangia, forming a **zygospore** (2n)
8. A **Gametangium** is a structure that produces gametes in Rhizopus
9. The **parent hyphae die** away and the zygospores are released. The zygospore can remain dormant for a number of months. When conditions are suitable the zygospore germinates by meiosis.
10. This produces haploid hypha which grows and produces a sporangium
