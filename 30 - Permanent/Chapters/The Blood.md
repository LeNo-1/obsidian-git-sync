The average human adult has *4-5 litres* of blood.
### Composition of Blood
Blood has four components - **plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets**

###### Plasma
Plasma is the liquid part of the blood. It is a straw-coloured liquid consisting of 90% water and 10% dissolved substances. Dissolved substances include:
1. **Nutrients** - glucose, amino acids, minerals, vitamins etc
2. **Wastes** - urea, uric acid
3. **Gases** - carbon dioxide
4. **Hormones** 
5. **Plasma proteins** - e.g. antibodies, clotting factors
> Serum is plasma from which clotting factors have been removed
- Functions of plasma - It is a transport medium

 ##### Red Blood Cells
- Red blood cells are produced in bone marrow of long bones e.g. ribs
- Their biconcave shape gives a large surface area to carry oxygen
- When first produced they have a nucleus but when full formed, they have no nucleus which gives them more room to carry oxygen
- Because they have no nucleus they cannot repair themselves and so survive only about 120 days
- They are broken down in the liver and spleen and the iron in them is recycled
- They do not have mitochondria, as it would use up the oxygen they carry
- Red blood cells are filled with a red pigment called **haemoglobin** a protein containing iron. Lack of iron in the diet causes a condition called **anemia**
- The function of haemoglobin is to combine with oxygen to form **oxyhaemoglobin**. This is the form that oxygen is carried around the body
- Pregnant women are often given iron tablets because the baby drains the iron that it needs, putting the mother at risk of becoming anaemic
- Athletes do high altitude training to increase their red blood cell count. This allows them to carry oxygen more efficiently for energy release
### Functions of blood
- Transport
	1. **Oxygen** $O_2$ from the lungs to all cells combined to haemoglobin (*oxyhaemoglobin*) in red blood cells
	2. **Carbon Dioxide** $CO_2$ from all cells to the lungs. Most of the carbon dioxide is carried as bicarbonate ions dissolved ion plasma
	3. **Digested foods** from the digestive system (ileum) to cells, dissolved in plasma
	4. **Wastes e.g. urea** from liver to kidney, dissolved in the plasma
	5. **Hormones** from endocrine gland to target organ, dissolved in plasma
- Defence
	1. **Monocytes**  engulf germs (*these cells are also called phagocytes*). Engulfing process called Phagocytosis
	2. **Lymphocytes** produce antibiotics
	3. **Platelets** help to clot blood and seal wound when you have a cut

### Blood Groups (ABO / RHESUS)
 Blood types are an important aspect of human genetics, categorized into four main ABO groups (A, B, AB, and O) and multiple Rh factors (positive or negative). The ABO system is based on the presence or absence of specific antigens on the surface of red blood cells:

- Type A has the A antigen.
- Type B has the B antigen.
- Type AB has both A and B antigens. - Universal Recipient
- Type O has neither A nor B antigens. - Universal Donor

The Rh factor, discovered by Landsteiner in 1940, adds an extra layer to blood typing. The positive Rh factor indicates the presence of the Rh protein on red blood cells, while the negative Rh factor means it is absent. It's crucial for successful blood transfusions and pregnancies, as incompatible blood types can lead to complications such as haemolytic disease of the new born or transfusion reactions. Understanding one's blood type and Rh factor aids in ensuring safe and effective donation and transfusion practices.
