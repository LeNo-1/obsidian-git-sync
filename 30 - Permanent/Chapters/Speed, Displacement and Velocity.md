### Time
- The SI Unit of time is the *second (s)*
- -> Time is a *scalar quantity*

### Speed
>[!NOTE] **Speed** is the rate of change with respect to time
- The SI unit of speed is $ms^{-1}$
- $Average Speed=\frac{Distance Travelled}{Time Taken}$

### Displacement
>[!NOTE] **Displacement** is distance in a given direction
- The symbol for displacement is *s*
- The unit of displacement is the *meter(m)*
- -> Displacement is a *vector quantity*  

### Velocity
>[!NOTE] **Velocity** is the rate of change of *displacement* with respect to time
- The SI unit of velocity is the $ms^{-1}$
- $Average Velocity=\frac{Displacement Distance}{Time Taken}$
- -> Velocity is a *vector quantity*
