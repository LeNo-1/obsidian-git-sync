## Work
>[!note] When a **force F** moves a body a **displacement** s in the direction of the force, the **work W** done is equal to the force multiplied by the displacement

$$Work=Force\times Displacement W=Fs$$
- The unit of work is the *joule* (J / N m)
- It is a *scalar quantity*
## Energy
>[!note] **Energy** is the *ability to do work*. The amount of energy something has is the amount of work it can do

- Energy is a *scalar quantity*
- Measured in *joules* 
#### Kinetic Energy
 - The energy a body has due to its motion 
 $$E_k=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
 
#### Potential Energy
 - The energy a body has due to its prostitution in a force field
###### Potential energy due to gravity:
 $$E_p=mgh$$
 
###### Electromagnetic Energy
- A form of energy transmitted from one point to another in the form of electromagnetic waves
- Travel at the speed of light (3x10^8 ms)
## Power
>[!note] **Power** is the *rate at which work is done*.

>[!note] **Power** is the *rate* at *which energy is converted from one form to another*

$$Average\space Power = \frac{Work \space Done}{Time \space Taken} \space P=\frac{W}{t}$$
$$Average\space Power = \frac{Energy\space Convertedd}{Time\space Taken} \space P=\frac{E}{t}$$
- Measured in the *watt* (W/ J s^-1)

### Efficiency
$$
Percentage \space Efficiency = \frac{Power\space Output}{Power\space Input}
$$
