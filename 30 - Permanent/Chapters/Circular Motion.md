## Measuring Angles
In everyday life angles are measured in a unit called the *degree ($\degree$)*

### The Radian
- *When you rotate a distance of the radius that is **1 radian***

>[!note] **One Radian** is the angle at the centre of a circle subtended by an *arc*, which is equal in length to the *radius of the circle*

$$Angle In Radians = \frac{Arc Length}{Radius}\rightarrow \theta=\frac{s}{r}$$
$$180\degree = \pi \space rad \rightarrow 180\degree = 3.14... \space rad$$
## Particle Moving in a Circle
>[!note] *Angular Velocity* -- the rate of change of the angle with respect to time

$$\omega =\frac{\theta}{t}$$
- The **SI Unit** is the *radian per second ($rad\space s^{-1}$)*
- *Scalar Quantity*

### Relationship between Linear and Angular Velocity
A disc rotates with constant angular velocity ($\omega$) about its centre
- The greater the distance a particle on the disc is from the centre the greater its linear velocity ($v$).

### Derive relationship between Linear and Angular velocity
$$ v=\frac{2\pi R}{T}\space w=\frac{2\pi}{T}\rightarrow v=\omega r$$

### Centripetal Force / Acceleration
$$F=\frac{mv^2}{r} \space OR \space F=m\omega^2r$$
$$\therefore a=\frac{v^2}{r} \space OR \space a=\omega^2r$$
### Newtons law of Universal Gravitation
$$\frac{Gm_1m_2}{d^2}$$
- Directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them

### Deriving Period of Orbit and Radius
$$\frac{mv^2}{R}=\frac{GmM}{R^2}\rightarrow v^2=\frac{GM}{R}$$

$$T=\frac{2\pi R}{v}\rightarrow T^2=\frac{4\pi^2 R^2}{v^2} \rightarrow  \frac{4\pi^2 R^2}{(GM/R)}$$
$$T^2=\frac{4\pi^2 R^3}{GM}$$
