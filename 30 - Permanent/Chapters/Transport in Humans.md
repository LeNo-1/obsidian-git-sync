# Circulatory System
Small animals e.g. Amoeba which consists of only one cell can rely on diffusion o supply them with oxygen and food to remove wastes. This would not meet the needs for larger animals as distances to be moved are too far.

| **Open System**   | ❌                          |
| **Closed System** | ✅                          |
>  Closed blood systems are more efficient because blood is pumped faster and it allows the flow of blood to different organs to be increased or decreased as needed e.g. the blood flow to the leg muscles is increased when you are running to deliver more oxygen.

## Blood Vessels
### Veins and Arteries
![[image-1.png|T.S. of Artery and Vein]]
Going from outside in:
- Fibrous Wall
- Muscle and elastic fibres
- Endothelium
- Lumen

### Capillaries
Capillaries *link* arteries and veins. It is in Capillaries that the exchange of materials between the body cells and blood takes place by diffusion. The capillaries are well adapted for efficient exchange
1. Capillaries have a **thin wall** which is only **one cell thick**. This ensures that materials can pass through it easily.
>[!NOTE]  The thinness of the capillary walls makes the exchange of materials with cells possible and so allows us to have a closed circulatory system
2. Capillaries are very branched and cover a large surface area. This ensures that blood is delivered to all cells
3. Capillaries are very narrow. This ensures all cells are close to a capillary and this allows easy entry and exit of materials

## The Heart
The heart is located in the **thoracic or chest cavity**
It is made up of **cardiac muscle** ( it is not under our conscious control and does not tire ). It is surrounded by a double membrane ( **Pericardium** ). The pericardium fluid between the two membranes prevents friction between beats
@ diagram of heart in thoracic cavity

@ diagram of heart
**Four chambers in the heart**:
Left atrium and left ventricle
Right atrium and right ventricle
Ventricles are to the bottom of heart and have thicker walls than atria as they pump blood out of the heart, the atria just pump blood down to the ventricles
The left ventricle has thicker walls than the right ventricle. The left ventricle pumps the blood further - all over the body while the right ventricle pumps the blood a shorter distance to the lungs
>[!tip]  **Remember**: Left is right and right is left when labelling the heart.

**Four valves in the heart:**
**Tricuspid valve**: Prevents back flow of blood from the right ventricle back up to the right atrium
**Bicuspid valve**: Prevents back flow of blood from the left ventricle back up to the left atrium
**Semi-lunar valves**: Prevents back flow from the arteries back down into the ventricles. ( They are located at the base of the pulmonary artery and aorta )
>[!note] The pulmonary artery and aorta are the only arteries with valves

**Four major blood vessels connected to the heart:**
**Vena cava**: Carries deoxygenated blood to the right atrium from the body
**Pulmonary artery**: Carries deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs
**Pulmonary vein**: Carries deoxygenated blood to the left atrium from the lungs
**Aorta**: Carries oxygenated blood from the heart to the body

##### Double Circulation 
Humans have a double circulatory system - (1) the **pulmonary system** - which pumps blood from the heart to lungs and back, and (2) the **systemic system** - which pumps blood from the heart to the body and back.

The advantages of a double circulatory system are that (a) it ensures that
