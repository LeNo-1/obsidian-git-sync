# Circulatory System
Small animals e.g. Amoeba which consists of only one cell can rely on diffusion o supply them with oxygen and food to remove wastes. This would not meet the needs for larger animals as distances to be moved are too far.

| **Open System**   | ❌                          |
| **Closed System** | ✅                          |
>  Closed blood systems are more efficient because blood is pumped faster and it allows the flow of blood to different organs to be increased or decreased as needed e.g. the blood flow to the leg muscles is increased when you are running to deliver more oxygen.

## Blood Vessels
### Veins and Arteries
![[image-1.png|T.S. of Artery and Vein]]
Going from outside in:
- Fibrous Wall
- Muscle and elastic fibres
- Endothelium
- Lumen

| *2.* | Blood under high pressure - being pumped out from heart | Blood under low pressure - but as skeletal muscles contract they press on the veins squeezing blood along |
| *3.* | Valves absent *                                         | Valves present to prevent backflow *                                                                      |

| *7.* | Carries oxygenated blood - except pulmonary artery      | Carries deoxygenated blood - except pulmonary vein                                                        |
### Capillaries
Capillaries *link* arteries and veins. It is in Capillaries that the exchange of materials between the body cells and blood takes place by diffusion. The capillaries are well adapted for efficient exchange
1. Capillaries have a **thin wall** which is only **one cell thick**
