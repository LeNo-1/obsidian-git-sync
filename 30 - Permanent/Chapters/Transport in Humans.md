# Circulatory System
Small animals e.g. Amoeba which consists of only one cell can rely on diffusion o supply them with oxygen and food to remove wastes. This would not meet the needs for larger animals as distances to be moved are too far.

| **Open System**   | ❌                          |
| **Closed System** | ✅                          |
>  Closed blood systems are more efficient because blood is pumped faster and it allows the flow of blood to different organs to be increased or decreased as needed e.g. the blood flow to the leg muscles is increased when you are running to deliver more oxygen.

## Blood Vessels
### Veins and Arteries

### Capillaries
Capillaries *link* arteries and veins. It is in Capillaries that the exchange of materials between the body cells and blood takes place by diffusion. The capillaries are well adapted for efficient exchange
1. Capillaries have a **thin wall** which is only **one cell thick**. This ensures that materials can pass through it easily.
>[!NOTE]  The thinness of the capillary walls makes the exchange of materials with cells possible and so allows us to have a closed circulatory system
2. Capillaries are very branched and cover a large surface area. This ensures that blood is delivered to all cells
3. Capillaries are very narrow. This ensures all cells are close to a capillary and this allows easy entry and exit of materials

## The Heart
The heart is located in the **thoracic or chest cavity**
It is made up of **cardiac muscle** ( it is not under our conscious control and does not tire ). It is surrounded by a double membrane ( **Pericardium** ). The pericardium fluid between the two membranes prevents friction between beats
@ diagram of heart in thoracic cavity

@ diagram of heart
**Four chambers in the heart**:
Left atrium and left ventricle
Right atrium and right ventricle
Ventricles are to the bottom of heart and have thicker walls than atria as they pump blood out of the heart, the atria just pump blood down to the ventricles
The left ventricle has thicker walls than the right ventricle. The left ventricle pumps the blood further - all over the body while the right ventricle pumps the blood a shorter distance to the lungs
>[!tip]  **Remember**: Left is right and right is left when labelling the heart.

**Four valves in the heart:**
**Tricuspid valve**: Prevents back flow of blood from the right ventricle back up to the right atrium
**Bicuspid valve**: Prevents back flow of blood from the left ventricle back up to the left atrium
**Semi-lunar valves**: Prevents back flow from the arteries back down into the ventricles. ( They are located at the base of the pulmonary artery and aorta )
>[!note] The pulmonary artery and aorta are the only arteries with valves

**Four major blood vessels connected to the heart:**
**Vena cava**: Carries deoxygenated blood to the right atrium from the body
**Pulmonary artery**: Carries deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs
**Pulmonary vein**: Carries deoxygenated blood to the left atrium from the lungs
**Aorta**: Carries oxygenated blood from the heart to the body

##### Double Circulation 
Humans have a double circulatory system - (1) the **pulmonary system** - which pumps blood from the heart to lungs and back, and (2) the **systemic system** - which pumps blood from the heart to the body and back.

The advantages of a double circulatory system are that (a) it ensures that the blood pressure is high enough in both systems and (b) it keeps the oxygenated blood separate from the deoxygenated blood. ((LORD))

**Portal system**: A portal system is a blood pathway that begins and ends in capillaries. The hepatic portal vein carries blood from the capillaries in the stomach and intestines to capillaries in the liver

**Coronary circulation**: the heart muscle has its own blood supply with the coronary arteries which branches off the aorta bringing blood to the heart wall and the coronary veins draining blood away from the heart wall returning the blood directly to the right atrium. Blockage of these arteries causes a heart attack.

**Cardiac Cycle**: This rhythmic contraction ( **systole** ) and relaxation ( **diastole** ) of the heart muscle, which results in the flow of blood through the heart and around the body.

 The cardiac cycle is the sequence of events that occur as the heart contracts and relaxes, resulting in blood being pumped through the body. It consists of two main phases:

Stages in the cardiac cycle
1. The atria receive blood on the right from the vena cava and on the left from the pulmonary veins.
2. When full, the atria contract ( systole ) forcing open the tricuspid and bicuspid valves and pump blood into the ventricles.
3. When the ventricles are full of blood, they contract ( systole ) forcing open the semi-lunar valves and pump blood out of the pulmonary artery on the right and the aorta on the left
4. When the atria are in systole, the ventricles are in diastole and vice versa.

###### Sino - Atrial Node
Location: The sino-atrial node or pacemaker is group of **specialised cells found high up in the wall of the right atrium**
Role: The SA node initialises the heart beat by sending a wave of electrical impulses over the two atria causing them to contract or systole
###### Atrioventricular Node (AV node)
Location: In the septum between the right atrium and the right ventricle near the tricuspid valve.
Role: The AV node sends a wave of electrical impulses over the two ventricles causing them to contract or systole
@ image of SA and AV node

###### Pulse
> DEF: The expansion of an artery as blood is forced through it is the pulse - average pulse is **72bpm**
- It is *increased* by **exercise, smoking, stress**
- It is *decreased* by **sleep or rest and alcohol**

###### Blood Pressure
>DEF: Blood pressure is the force of the blood against the wall of an artery

The pressure is generated by the contraction of the ventricles pushing blood out of the heart. Human blood pressure is taken in an artery in the upper arm. The amount of force needed to stop the flow of blood in this artery is measured. Normal blood pressure for a young adult is about 120/80.

Effects if Smoking, Diet, and Exercise on the Circulatory System
Smoking:
1. Carbon monoxide in smoke causes hardening of the arteries which ,ay result in a heart attack
2. Nicotine increases blood pressure, which may cause a stroke
