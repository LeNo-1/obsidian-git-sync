# Food
## Functions of Food
1. To provide a source of *energy*
2. To provide the raw *materials needed for growth and repair*

## Elements in Food
Living organisms are *composed of elements*. Atoms of these elements *bond together in different ratios* to form molecule called **biomolecules** 

## The Six Most Common Elements in Food are:
1. Carbon (C)
2. Hydrogen (H)
3. Oxygen (O)
4. Nitrogen (N)
5. Sulphur (S)
6. Phosphorus (P)

## Five Elements that Occur in Food as Dissolved Mineral Salts
1. Sodium
2. Chloride
3. Potassium
4. Magnesium
5. Calcium

## Trace Elements
1. Zinc
2. Iron
3. Copper

# Biomolecules
> [!NOTE] A **biomolecule** is a molecule found in *living organisms*

1. Carbohydrates 
2. Lipids - fats and oils
3. Vitamins
4. Proteins
**DNA** and **RNA** are other examples of important biomolecules in our body

## Carbohydrates
### Elements
$$C_x(H_2O)y$$
 - Where x=y
### Structure
- The smallest unit of a carbohydrate is a *monosaccharide*
        $\nearrow Monosaccharide\space (1)$
$\large{Sugar\space Units} \rightarrow \normalsize{Diasaccharide\space (2)}$ 
        $\searrow Polysaccharide\space (2+)$

### Functions
#### A) Structural
**Cellulose** : Plant Cell Walls
**Chitin** : Fungi Cell Walls

#### B) Metabolic
**Glucose** : Energy Source 
**Starch** : Energy Store in Plants
**Glycogen** : Energy Store in Animals (Liver, Muscle, Brain)
## Lipids - Fats\Oils
### Elements
Carbon\ Hydrogen\ Oxygen (More H and less O than Carbohydrates)
### Structure
- The basic unit of a fat is called a *triglyceride*
 - Consists of *3 fatty acids*

**Phospholipid** : One of the 3 fatty acids is replaced with a phosphate group

**Fats v Oils** : A fat is solid while an oil is liquid at room temperature

**Ex.** ⇾ Butter, Margarine, Cooking Oil
### Functions
#### A) Structural
- Phospholipids in cell membranes
- Insulation, protection of organs e.g. kidney
#### B) Metabolic
- Energy Storage
## Proteins
### Elements 
Carbon \Hydrogen \Oxygen \Nitrogen (Mat contain Sulphur and\or Phosphorus)

### Structure
- The smallest unit of a protein is an *amino acid*
- Proteins consist of a chain of amino acids joined by *peptide bonds* (20 common amino acids)
- Functional proteins are *folded in a specific 3D shape*
- May be *fibrous* with a little folding or *globular* with much folding

**Ex.** ⇾ Meat, Fish, Beans
### Functions
#### a) Structural
- Keratin in hair
- Myosin in muscle
#### b) Metabolic
- Enzymes
- Hormones

## Vitamins

|                         | *Vitamin C*                    | *Vitamin D*                                         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fat / Water Soluble** | Water                          | Fat                                                 |
| **Source**              | Oranges, Lemons                | Milk , Cod-liver, Sunlight on skin                  |
| **Function**            | Formation of connective tissue | Absorbs calcium from the gut to help bone formation |
| **Deficiency**          | Scurvy                         | Rickets                                             |
| **Symptoms**            | Bleeding<br>                   | Weak Bons                                           |
## Minerals
**Mineral Salts Needed** : Sodium / Chloride / Potassium / Magnesium / Calcium
*Trace Elements* : Zinc / Iron / Copper

### Functions
- Rigid body structures e.g. calcium in bone
- Soft body tissues
- Body fluids
##### Animals
1. **Calcium** : To form bones and teeth
2. **Iron** : To form hemoglobin

##### Plants
1. **Calcium** : To form middle lamella which cements cells together
2. **Magnesium** : To form chlorophyll

# Experiments
## To Test for Carbohydrates
**Starch**: Starch turns *iodine* from *brown* to *blue-black*
1. Dissolve food sample in water and put into test tube
2. Using dropper add iodine solution (brown)
**Reducing Sugar**: When heated with *Benedict's Solution*, they turn it from *blue* to *brick red* (Heat not boil)
1. Dissolve the food sample in water and put into a test tube
2. Add Benedict's Solution (blue)
3. Heat in a water bath (not boil)
## Test for Fats/Oils
Makes *brown paper translucent*
1. Rub food sample on brown paper and leave to dry
## Test for Protein
Turns *Biuret Reagent* from *blue* to *lilac*
1. Dissolve the food sample in water and put into a test tube
2. Using a dropper add Biuret Reagent (blue)
