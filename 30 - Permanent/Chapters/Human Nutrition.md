### Introduction
- Heterotrophs : Animals are __heterotrophs__ - they *cannot make their own food*. Animals must consume their food
	- Herbivores : eats plants only e.g. rabbit
	- Carnivores : eats meat only e.g. rabbit
	- Omnivores : eats both plants and animals e.g. human

- Digestions : The breakdown of food into *small, soluble* pieces
	|-> To make food *soluble* so it can be absorbed into the bloodstream

### Stages in Human Nutrition
1. Ingestion : taking food in the mouth
2. Digestion : the mechanical and chemical breakdown of food into small soluble pieces
3. Absorption : the passage of digested food into the bloodstream
4. Egestion : the removal of undigested and unabsorbed food from the gut

###### Structure of the alimentary canal and associated glands

###### Mouth
In the mouth, food is physically digested by the action of the teeth and chemically digested by action of saliva. Saliva is produced by the salivary glands in the mouth and contains an enzyme called **amylase** which acts on starch. Saliva moistens the food making it easier to swallow. When swallowing a flap called the *epiglottis* closes off the opening to the trachea preventing food going down the 'wrong way'

###### Oesophagus
This short tube carries food to the stomach by **a wave of muscular contraction of its wall** called *peristalsis* 

###### Stomach
The cardiac and pyloric sphincter muscles trap the food in the stomach. It holds about a litre of food for up to 4 hours. Here the food is physically digested by the contraction of the muscles in the stomach wall. It is acted on chemically by gastric juice produced by gastric glands in the wall of the stomach. gastric juice contains (a) **mucous** which lines the stomach wall and protects it from the action of gastric juice, (b) **Hydrochloric acid** (i) which kills bacteria and (ii)  provides a suitable pH medium for the action of enzyme pepsin, (c) **pepsin** which acts on protein. After about 4 hours in the stomach, ingested food is in the form of a semi-solid liquid called **chyme**. The pyloric sphincter muscle at the base of the stomach relaxes to allow chyme to pass on in small portions into the duodenum 

###### Small Intestine
1. In the duodenum food is mixed with juices from 3 sources:
	- (a) **bile** produced by the liver, stored in the gall bladder and delivered into the duodenum by the bile duct. Bile emulsifies fats (breaks into small droplets) and neutralises the acidic food from the stomach
	- (b) **intestinal juice** with digestive enzyme produced by the wall of the duodenum
	- (c) **pancreatic juice** with digestive enzymes produced by the pancreas and delivered into the duodenum by the pancreatic duct
2. In the ileum, absorption of digested food occurs

###### Large Intestine
The large intestine consists of the *caecum, appendix, colon, rectum, and the anus*. The main functions of the large intestine are to (a) **reabsorb water and** (b) **egestion of faeces**

#### Mechanical Digestion
**Mechanical digestion is physical digestion** and plays an important role in the breakdown of food. Mechanical digestion physically breaks the large pieces of food into smaller ones providing a **greater surface area** for enzyme action. There are many examples of mechanical digestion in the alimentary canal:
- (a) **Chewing by the teeth** in the mouth breaks down the food into smaller pieces. This makes the food easier to swallow and the small pieces provide a much larger surface area for enzyme breakdown
- (b) **Peristalsis is a wave of muscular contraction of the gut wall that moves that food along the alimentary canal.** 
- (c) **Churning of the food in the stomach** by the contraction of the muscles in the stomach wall converts the solid food into a semi-solid liquid called *chyme* 

###### Teeth
There are four types of tooth: **Incisors for biting, canines for tearing, premolars and molars for chewing **

### Chemical Digestion
Chemical digestion is the **action of enzymes and bile** salts to breakdown food into a soluble form that can be absorbed

**Carbohydrates** are broken down into *monosaccharides*
**Proteins** are broken down into *amino acids*
**Fats** are broken down into *fatty acids and glycerol*

### Absorption of Food:
The products of digestion are absorbed from the alimentary canal in the second part of the small intestine - the ileum. The wall of the ileum is thrown into folds called villi. Each villus contains a network of blood capillaries which surround a central lymph vessel called a **lacteal**. Digested carbohydrates (monosaccharides), proteins (amino acids), minerals and vitamins pass from the ileum through the wall of the villus into the blood capillaries by diffusion. The capillaries carry the nutrients to the *==hepatic portal vein==* which takes them to the liver. Digested fats (fatty acids and glycerol) do not pass into the blood stream but into the lacteals which carries the digested fats to the lymph system which eventually pass them into the bloodstream.

#### Adaptions of the Small Intestine for its Function
The *3 main functions* of the small intestine are (a) **movement of the food along its length**, (b) **chemical digestion**, (c) **absorption of digested nutrients**
- (a) **Movement of food:**
	- The wall of the small intestine has two layers of muscle - the circular and longitudinal for peristalsis, which mixed the food with digestive juices and pushes it along. Peristalsis is aided by fibre
- (b) **Chemical digestion**
	- Cells in the lining of the intestine produce digestive juices containing enzymes that digest food into small soluble products
- (c) **Absorption**
	1.  It is very *long* increasing the surface area for maximum absorption
	2. The wall is not smooth but thrown into folds called villi which increase the surface area for absorption
	3. The cells lining the ileum are one cell thick allowing rapid movement of digested food through them
	4. In the villi, there is a dense network of blood capillaries and lacteals to transport the digested food away from the ileum

#### Large Intestine
This consists of the **caecum, appendix, colon, rectum and anus**. The main functions of the large intestine are (a) absorb water and (b) form faeces which is egested out of anus.
The large intestine is also a habitat for **symbiotic bacteria**
> Symbiosis is two organisms living together for mutual benefit
- They are important because (a) they produce vitamins (B and K) , (b) they protect us against other pathogenic bacteria by competing with them for space

 Benefits of Dietary Fibre
---
**Fibre** consists of indigestible cellulose plant cell walls. Fibre or roughage is *important in the diet* because it:
1. Stimulates peristalsis
2. It absorbs water keeping faeces soft and preventing constipation
3. Decreases risk of colon cancer

 Balanced Diet
---
A balanced diet is one which contains the right amounts of each food type to keep you healthy. A balanced diet varies from one person to another depending on their age gender and activity levels.
The food pyramid shows the recommended daily portions of each food type.

#### Liver
@ image of liver

The liver, which is found in the **upper right abdomen** is the largest internal organ in the body. It has many important metabolic roles which is reflected by its extensive blood supply. It is fed with oxygen rich blood by the **hepatic artery** and nutrient rich blood by the **hepatic portal vein**. Blood leaves the liver in the **hepatic vein**. The livers functions are:
1. Produce bile which **emulsifies fats**
2. **Deaminates** excess protein to form *urea* 
3. Detoxifies alcohol
4. Stores excess carbohydrates in the form of **glycogen** 
5. It stores vitamins e.g. Vitamin A and minerals e.g. iron
6. Breaks down worn out red blood cells recycling the iron in them
