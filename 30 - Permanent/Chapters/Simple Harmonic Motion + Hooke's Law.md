# Hooke's Law
>[!NOTE] Hooke's law states that when certain elastic objects are stretched or compressed by displacement s the **restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement** 

$$F=-ks$$
- k is the elastic constant or the spring constant
## Simple Harmonic Motion
There is one position O where the upward force on the mass due to the spring is equal to its weight. If the mass is placed at O at rest it will remain there. O is called the *equilibrium position*.

A body moves with **Simple Harmonic Motion** if:
- Its *acceleration* is directly *proportional to its distance* from a fixed *point on its path*
- Its *acceleration* is always *directed towards that point*
$$a=-\omega^2 s$$
a-> acceleration $\omega$-> constant s->displacement

#### If a System always obeys Hook's Law:
$$F=-ks\rightarrow ma=-ks \rightarrow a=-\frac{k}{m}s$$
$$a=-\omega ^2s=-\frac{k}{m}s\rightarrow\omega^2=\frac{k}{m}$$
E.g Prong on tuning fork
### Terms Used to describe Simple Harmonic Motion
- a *cycle* or *oscillation* is the movement from A to Band back to A again
- The *period time* or the *period* T of a particle is the time for one complete oscillation
- the *frequency* f  is the number of cycles occurring per second. Measured in Hertz (Hz)
$$T=\frac{1}{f}\space \space and \space\space f=\frac{1}{T}$$
- The *amplitude* is the greatest displacement that the particle has from the equilibrium position.
$$T=\frac{2\pi}{\omega}$$
