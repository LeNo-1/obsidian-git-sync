> [!What is Life?]
> ->Life may be defined as something that ==possesses metabolism and continuity==

# Intro
We are surrounded by living things. The tees the flowers in the garden, other human beings, our pets and other animals are all [[#Organisms]].

The enormous complexity of our worlds [[#Biodiversity]] is an interesting aspect of life as it relies on the a sort of trust between animals. 
##### Metabolism and Continuity
 [[#Metabolism]] is process which all organism utilise to survive. There are two types of metabolism, *anabolism* and *catabolism*
 
 [[#Continuity]] is the survivability of an organism.  
### The Characteristics of Life:
1. [[#Organisation]]
2. [[#Nutrition]]
3. [[#Excretion]]
4. [[#Response]]
5. [[#Reproduction]]
*(Something must show ALL of the characteristics to be considered 'alive')*
