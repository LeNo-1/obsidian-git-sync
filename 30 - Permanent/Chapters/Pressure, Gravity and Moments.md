## Density
>[!Note] The **density** of a substance is its mass per unit volume
- The unit for density is the *kilogram per cubic metre* kg m^-3
$$Density = \frac{Mass}{Volume}\rightarrow \rho=\frac{m}{V}$$
## Pressure
>[!Note] **Pressure** is *force per unit area*
- The unit of pressure is the *pascal* (Pa)
	- 1 Pa = 1 N m^-2
$$Pressure=\frac{Force}{Area}\rightarrow P=\frac{F}{A}$$
### Pressure Due to a Liquid
At a depth $h$ in a liquid of a density $\rho$ where the acceleration due to gravity is *g*
$$P=\rho gh$$
- Pressure increases with depth
- Pressure acts perpendicular to any surface put in the liquid
- At a given depth the value of pressure is the same in all directions
#### Upthrust on an Object Immersed in a Fluid
 - **Archimedes Principle** states that when an object is *partially or completely immersed in a fluid* it experiences an *upthrust* equal in magnitude to the *weight of the liquid displaced*
#### The Law of Flotation
- The **Law of Flotation** states that the *weight of a floating body* is equal to the *weight of the liquid it displaces*
### Boyle's Law
**Boyle's Law** states that at a *constant temperature* the *volume of a fixed mass of gas* is *inversely proportional to its pressure*
$$p\propto \frac{1}{V} \rightarrow \space k(\frac{1}{V})\rightarrow pV=k$$
## Gravity
### Newtons Law of Universal Gravitation
**Newtons Law of Universal Gravitation** states that *any two point masses* in the universe attract each other with a force that is *directly proportional to the product of the masses* and *inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them*.
$F\propto m_1m_2 \space and \space F=\frac{1}{d^2} \rightarrow F\propto \frac{m_1m_2}{d^2}$
$$F=\frac{Gm_1m_2}{d^2}$$
- Where $G$ is the **Universal Gravitation Constant**
### Gravity on a planet
$W=gm \rightarrow W=\frac{GMm}{R^2} \rightarrow gm=\frac{GMm}{R^2}$
$$g=\frac{GM}{R^2}$$
also
$$g_d=\frac{GM}{D^2}$$
## Moments
> [!note] The **moment** of a force about an axis is equal to the *magnitude of the force multiplied by the perpendicular distance from the axis* to the line of action of the force

$$Moment\space Force = Force \times Perpendicular \space Distance $$
- The unit of moment is the *newton metre* (N m)
### Clockwise and Anticlockwise Moments
### Equilibrium
if a body is in **equilibrium** then:
- The vector sum of the forces in any direction is zero
- the sum of the moments about any point is zero
### Levers
A rigid body which is free to rotate about a fixed point is called a lever. The point about which it rotates is called the *fulcrum*. The force exerted on the lever is the *effort*. The lever is able to magnify the size of the force.
### Couples
Two parallel forces with the same magnitude acting in opposite directions is called a couple.
$$Momement\space of\space Couple \space (Torque) \space T=Fd$$
