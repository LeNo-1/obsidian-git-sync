### Rules of Rays

> [!Types of Images]
> ##### Real Image
>A real image is an image formed by the actual intersection of rays.
>- Can be seen on a screen
>##### Virtual Image
>A virtual image is an image formed by the apparent intersection of rays.
>- Can be seen on a mirror

### Convex Lens

### Concave Lens
![[object-at-different-distances-from-the-lens-24-3.44a8176.webp|300]]
1. The image is always *virtual and upright* and located at the same side of the lens as the object
![[object-at-different-distances-from-the-lens-24-5.6797abe.webp|300]]
2. The image is always *diminished*. The nearer the object is to the lens the bigger the image is.
## Formulae
## $\frac{1}{u}+\frac{1}{v}=\frac{1}{f}$

v is **+** for a *real image*  | v is **-** for a *virtual image*
f is **+** for a *convex lens* | f is **-** for *concave lens*

## $Magnification=\large\frac{v}{u}$

## $Power~of~Lens=\frac{1}{f}$
-> The shorter the focal length the greater the power of the lens
