# The Poem
- “Hold on,” she said, “I’ll just run out and get him.
- The weather here’s so good, *he took the chance*
- *To do a bit of weeding.”*

-  *So I saw him*  
5. Down on his hands and knees beside the leek rig,
- Touching, inspecting, separating one
- Stalk from the other, gently pulling up
- Everything not tapered, frail and leafless,
- Pleased to feel each little weed-root break,
10. *But rueful also . . .*

- Then found myself listening to
- The amplified grave ticking of hall clocks
- Where *the phone lay unattended* in a calm
- Of mirror glass and sunstruck pendulums . . .

15. And found myself then thinking: if it were nowadays,
 -  *This is how Death would summon Everyman*.

- Next thing he spoke and *I nearly said I loved him*.
