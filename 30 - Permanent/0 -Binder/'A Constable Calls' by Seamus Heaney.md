# The Poem
 - His bicycle stood at the window-sill,  
 - The rubber cowl of a mud-splasher  
 - Skirting the front mudguard,  
 - Its fat black handlegrips

 5. Heating in sunlight, the “spud”  
 - Of the dynamo gleaming and cocked back,  
 - The pedal treads hanging relieved  
 - Of the *boot of the law*[^1].

 - His cap was upside down 
10. On the floor, next his chair.  
 - The line of its pressure ran like a bevel  
 - In his slightly sweating hair.

 - He had unstrapped  
 - The heavy ledger, and my father  
 15. Was making tillage returns  
 - In acres, roods, and perches.

 - *Arithmetic and fear*.  
 - I sat staring at the polished holster  
 - With its buttoned flap, the braid cord  
 20. Looped into the revolver butt.

 - “Any other root crops?  
 - Mangolds? Marrowstems? Anything like that?”  
 - “No.” But was there not a line  
 - Of turnips where the seed ran out

25. In the potato field? I assumed  
 - Small guilts and sat  
 - Imagining *the black hole in the barracks*.  
 - He stood up, shifted the baton-case

 - Further round on his belt,  
 30. Closed the *domesday book*,  
 - Fitted his cap back with two hands,  
 - And looked at me as he said goodbye.

 - A shadow bobbed in the window.  
 - He was snapping the carrier spring  
 - Over the ledger. His boot pushed off  
 35. And the bicycle *ticked ticked ticked*.
