### Introduction
- Heterotrophs : Animals are __heterotrophs__ - they *cannot make their own food*. Animals must consume their food
	- Herbivores : eats plants only e.g. rabbit
	- Carnivores : eats meat only e.g. rabbit
	- Omnivores : eats both plants and animals e.g. human

- Digestions : The breakdown of food into *small, soluble* pieces
	|-> To make food *soluble* so it can be absorbed into the bloodstream

### Stages in Human Nutrition
1. Ingestion : taking food in the mouth
2. Digestion : the mechanical and chemical breakdown of food into small soluble pieces
3. Absorption : the passage of digested food into the bloodstream
4. Egestion : the removal of undigested and unabsorbed food from the gut

###### Structure of the alimentary canal and associated glands

###### Mouth
In the mouth, food is physically digested by the action of the teeth and chemically digested by action of saliva. Saliva is produced by the salivary glands in the mouth and contains an enzyme called **amylase** which acts on starch. Saliva moistens the food making it easier to swallow. When swallowing a flap called the *epiglottis* closes off the opening to the trachea preventing food going down the 'wrong way'

###### Oesophagus
This short tube carries food to the stomach by **a wave of muscular contraction of its wall** called *peristalsis* 

###### Stomach
The cardiac and pyloric sphincter muscles trap the food in the stomach. It holds about a litre of food for up to 4 hours. Here the food is physically digested by the contraction of the muscles in the stomach wall. It is acted on chemically by gastric juice produced by gastric glands in the wall of the stomach. gastric juice contains (a) **mucous** which lines the stomach wall and protects it from the action of gastric juice, (b) **Hydrochloric acid** (i) which kills bacteria and (ii)  provides a suitable pH medium for the action of enzyme pepsin, (c) **pepsin** which acts on protein. After about 4 hours in the stomach, ingested food is in the form of a semi-solid liquid called **chyme**. The pyloric sphincter muscle at the base of the stomach relaxes to allow chyme to pass on in small portions into the duodenum 

###### Small Intestine
1. In the duodenum food is mixed with juices from 3 sources:
	- (a) **bile** produced by the liver, stored in the gall bladder and delivered into the duodenum by the bile duct. Bile emulsifies fats (breaks into small droplets) and neutralises the acidic food from the stomach
	- (b) **intestinal juice** with digestive enzyme produced by the wall of the duodenum
	- (c) **pancreatic juice** with digestive enzymes produced by the pancreas and delivered into the duodenum by the pancreatic duct
2. In the ileum, absorption of digested food occurs

###### Large Intestine
The large intestine consists of the *caecum, appendix, colon, rectum, and the anus*. The main functions of the large intestine are to (a) **reabsorb water and** (b) **egestion of faeces**

##### Mechanical Digestion
**Mechanical digestion is physical digestion** and plays an important role in the breakdown of food. Mechanical digestion physically breaks the large pieces of food into smaller ones providing a **greater surface area** for enzyme action. There are many examples of mechanical digestion in the alimentary canal:
- (a) **Chewing by the teeth** in the mouth breaks down the food into smaller pieces. This makes the food easier to swalloe and the samll pieces provide
