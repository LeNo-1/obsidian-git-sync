### Introduction
- Heterotrophs : Animals are __heterotrophs__ - they *cannot make their own food*. Animals must consume their food
	- Herbivores : eats plants only e.g. rabbit
	- Carnivores : eats meat only e.g. rabbit
	- Omnivores : eats both plants and animals e.g. human

- Digestions : The breakdown of food into *small, soluble* pieces
	|-> To make food *soluble* so it can be absorbed into the bloodstream

 ###### Stages in Human Nutrition
1. Ingestion : taking food in the mouth
2. Digestion : the mechanical and chemical breakdown of food into small soluble pieces
3. Absorption : the passage of digested food into the bloodstream
4. Egestion : the removal of undigested and unabsorbed food from the gut

###### Structure of the alimentary canal and associated glands

###### Mouth
In the mouth, food is physically digested by the action of the teeth and chemically digested by action of saliva. Saliva is produced by the salivary glands in the mouth and contains an enzyme called **amylase** which acts on starch. Saliva moistens the food making it easier to swallow. When swallowing a flap called the *epiglottis* closes off the opening
