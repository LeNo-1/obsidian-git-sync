The average human adult has *4-5 litres* of blood.
### Composition of Blood
Blood has four components - **plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets**

###### Plasma
Plasma is the liquid part of the blood. It is a straw-coloured liquid consisting of 90% water and 10% dissolved substances. Dissolved substances include:
1. **Nutrients** - glucose, amino acids, minerals, vitamins etc
2. **Wastes** - urea, uric acid
3. **Gases** - carbon dioxide
4. **Hormones** 
5. **Plasma proteins** - e.g. antibodies, clotting factors
> Serum is plasma from which clotting factors have been removed
- Functions of plasma - It is a transport medium

 ##### Red Blood Cells
- Red blood cells are produced in bone marrow of long bones e.g. ribs
- Their biconcave shape gives a large surface area to carry oxygen
- When first produced they have a nucleus but when full formed, they have no nucleus which gives them more room to carry oxygen
- Because they have no nucleus they cannot repair themselves and so survive only about 120 days
- They are broken down in the liver and spleen and the iron in them is recycled
- They do not have mitochondria, as it would use up the oxygen they carry
- Red blood cells are filled with a red pigment called **haemoglobin** a protein containing iron. Lack of iron in the diet causes a condition called **anemia**
- The function of haemoglobin is to combine with oxygen to form **oxyhaemoglobin**. This is the form that oxygen is carried around the body
- Pregnant women are often given iron tablets because the baby drains the iron that it needs, puttnig the mothe
